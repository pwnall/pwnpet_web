Computer management software.

== Installation

apt-get install libavahi-compat-libdnssd-dev

== Testing

Testing requires a VirtualBox VM with all default settings for Ubuntu, but add a
second network adapter, configured as a Host-only Adapter. As an optimization,
both network adapters can be switched to virtio-net (Paravirtualized Network).
As further optimizations, Audio and USB can be disabled.

When installing Ubuntu in the VM, use defaults for everything except:
* Name: Pwnpet Tester
* Computer Name: pwnpet-test
* Username: pwnpet
* Password: b00mheadsh0t
* Log in automatically

After installing, issue the following commands:
    sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get upgrade
    sudo apt-get install openssh-server avahi-daemon
    # The following is an optional speed optimization.
    sudo apt-get install virtualbox-ose-guest-dkms virtualbox-ose-guest-utils virtualbox-ose-guest-x11
